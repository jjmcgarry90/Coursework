Problem 1
---------

A) The HAL 9000 computer has 16 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.

The addressability of this memory is ?
The address space of this memory is ?


Problem 2
---------
What is the difference between level triggered and edge triggered logic?

What is the difference between combinational and sequential logic?

Ok now complete the following table

|=======================================================|
| Component | Edge | Level | Combinational | Sequential |
|=======================================================|
| ALU       |      |       |               |            |
| AND GATE  |      |       |               |            |
| REGISTER  |      |       |               |            |
| MEMORY    |      |       |               |            |
| ENCODER   |      |       |               |            |
| GATED D   |      |       |               |            |
| RS LATCH  |      |       |               |            |

Problem 3 (Easy)
---------
Answer the following.

So I have three LEDS red, green, and blue. And I want the circuit to behave as follows.

1) None of the LEDS are turned on
2) The red LED is the only led that is on
3) The green LED is the only led that is on
4) The blue LED is the only led that is on
5) All of the LEDs are turned on

So the leds should go
None On -> Red On -> Green On -> Blue On -> All On -> Back to None On.


1) How many states will you need for this state machine?
2) How many outputs will you have to this state machine?
3) How many inputs?

4) Now draw a state machine diagram for this circuit I suggest working with someone near you and getting a TA to check it over once you are done.
You can do this on paper or in paint or something. (You don't have to turn this in for this lab assignment)

5) Now take the state machine diagram you created and make it into a logisim circuit name it lab4Part3.circ


Problem 4 (Medium)
---------
So I then showed my circuit to Bill and he was not too happy with it since the LEDS flash all of the time!
Bill has told me that I should add an on/off button to my circuit to turn the flashing LEDs on and off.

Requirements
1) The machine starts off with the lights turned off
2) When I press and release the On/Off button the lights should behave as like in previous problem
3) When I press and release the button in the All On state the lights should turn off
4) Afterward if I press and release the button it should turn the lights on again.

1) How many states will you need for this state machine (Should be more than problem 2)?
2) How many inputs will this circuit have?
3) How many outputs will you now have to this state machine?
Note: Make sure that when I press the button that the machine doesn't turn on/off very rapidly! (Hint: dummy states)

4) Now draw a state machine diagram for this circuit I suggest working with someone near you and getting a TA to check it over once you are done.
(You don't have to turn this in for this lab assignment)

5) Implement this state machine as a circuit. Save it as lab4Part4.circ

Problem 5 (Hard)
---------
This system has three inputs as buttons A, B, and C and an output with is a single LED.  

Requirements
1) The circuit starts off with the LED turned off.
2) When button A is pressed then the LED should turn on and stay on even after A is released.
3) When button B is pressed the LED should turn off and turn on repeatedly even after B is released.
4) When button C is pressed the LED should turn off and stay off even after C is released.

1) Draw a state machine diagram for this circuit.  This one may be a bit tricky!

2) How many states will you need for this state machine?
3) How many inputs?
4) How many outputs?

5) Implement this state machine as a circuit. Save it as lab4Part5.circ
