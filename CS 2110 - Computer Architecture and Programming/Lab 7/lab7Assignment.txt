======================================================================

This is not a timed lab, so feel free to collaborate with your neighbors, use
the book, and ask the TAs for explanation if you need help. When you are done,
please submit your assignment to T-Square to get credit! for participating.
	
From this point onward turning in your lab assignment is mandatory.
Each lab is worth 10 points and you are to attempt the questions presented in the lab assignment.
If you turn in an empty document then you will get a zero for the lab.


1) Here I have this simple assembly program. Can you tell me what is in each of the indicated registers after I run it?
(Note: don't just open simpl and run this program I'm watching you!, just running it defeats the purpose of even asking this question)

.orig x3000
	LEA R0, SIMPLE 		;x3000
	LD R1, SIMPLE   		;x3001
	LDR R2, R1, #0  		;x3002
	LDR R3, R1, #1  		;x3003
	LDI R4, SIMPLE  		;x3004
	HALT				;x3005

	SIMPLE .fill x3500		;x3006
	BLARRG .fill #2110	;x3007
.end

.orig x3500
	ITSOVER .fill #9000	;x3500
	RANDOM .fill #42		;x3501
.end

R0: x3006
R1: x3500
R2: #9000
R3: #42
R4: #9000

2) Make the LC3 Register File.
	a) What are the inputs?
	b) What are the outputs?
	c) How many registers does the LC3 have?

3) Make the LC3 Logic. Controlling the NZP registers.


4) How does the and instruction work in the datapath? 

a) The contents of both registers are bitwise ANDed and that result
   is stored in DR.
b) If the most significant bit of the imm5 value is 1, then
   the value is sign extended before being ANDed with the source
   register. If the leading bit is 0, there is no sign extention.
