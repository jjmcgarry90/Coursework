===============================================================================

This assignment is due by:
	Day:	Tuesday, October 26, 2010

===============================================================================
			TURN IN THIS ASSIGNMENT ELECTRONICALLY USING T-SQUARE.
				LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
===============================================================================

======================================
Preparation: Learn the GBA Environment
======================================
As an additional resource we have included a file called VBAHowTo.txt. This file
contains instructions on setting up and using ham, which is our GBA environment.

You will also need to be somewhat familiar with makefiles.
You can also find more information about makefiles in the makeTutorial.txt file 
located here:
T-Square > CS-2110 > Resources > Technical Resources > Tutorials/Environment Setup > Make/Makefiles

========================================
Part 1: Create a GBA Library Files
========================================

The next step is to start coding C! The first thing we are going to do is
create files that can then later be used as a library for GBA programs. They
will contain all the basic functions and declarations that are common in normal
GBA programs. The point of this part of the assignment is to get you to create
files that contain everything you need to create a game boy game other than
the game code itself. If you want to write a new game, you can just use your
myLib.c and myLib.h files and fill in the unique code that pertains only to
your new game in a new file's main().

***NOTE!!************************************************************************
You will need to submit both these and your hw8.c file (part 2) to get full credit.
*********************************************************************************

Using a text editor of your choice, create a file called
myLib.h and add the following elements to the file:

Declarations:
 - REG_DISPCNT - The display control register, located at 0x4000000
 - u16 - An unsigned short type, used to represent memory locations in the GBA.
 	(this should be a typedef)
 - RGB - A macro you should #define at the beginning of your file.  This macro
         takes three integers representing the red, green and blue components
         of the color and returns the corresponding color value.

Using a text editor of your choice, create a file called
myLib.c and add the following elements to the file:

Declarations:
 - myLib.h - you need to include the myLib.h header file.
 - videoBuffer - The video buffer, located at 0x6000000
Functions:
       NOTE: None of these functions should be empty.
 - void setPixel(int r, int c, u16 color) {
                 A function to set pixel (r, c) to the color in the parameter.
   }
 - void drawRect(int r, int c, int width, int height, u16 color) {
                A function to draw a rectangle starting at (r, c)
   }

You will need to put a line of code in myLib.h that will make the videoBuffer in
myLib.c visible to your main program file, in the case of this homework hw8.c
(hint: look up extern).

We will go over a lot of these functions and declarations in lab (although
we recommend that you start before then, since you have also gone over most, if not
all, of them in lecture).  After building these files, you now have a fully functional
library. To test them out we will now create another program using it.

As you progress through the semester, you may find it useful to update and extend
these files or create a new, similar file, because you will be reusing a number
of functions, registers, and structures during the C part of this course.

This is why we have you create this library.
If you do well on creating this file the actual amount of coding you will do for the
next few homework assignments should be significantly easier.

=============================================
Part 2: Light A Few Pixels
=============================================

Create a new file named "hw8.c". 

Declarations:
 - myLib.h - you need to include the myLib.h header file.
Functions:
 - int main() {
 		Your main function.  Within this you should setup REG_DISPCNT
		and put your game loop.
   }

Add game code to hw8.c to create a basic GBA program that lights a few pixels.
This program should do the following:

	Light up at least 5 pixels in any pattern you want using at least 4
	different colors and the setPixel command. Use your creativity!

It is advised that you go above and beyond on this homework (feel free to research and implement more features in your gba program.)
A nice/easy thing to add would be button input and or images. The more you do for this homework the better off you will be in future assignments!

For the next assignment(s) you will be creating games for the GBA

In addition the best submissions for these next few assignments will be put in the hall of fame!

To run your program, you'll have to modify the included makefile.  If you are
not sure what to modify, go back and reread VBAHowTo.txt.
If everything is correct, you should be able to type

make vba

and see your program.

===========
Submission:
===========
Turn in all the files you have created and modified.  This will include:
   - myLib.h
   - myLib.c
   - hw8.c
   - makefile

Also note:
   - If you do not submit your modified makefile, your code will not compile and you
     will get a zero
