CS-2110                          Timed Lab #1                        Summer 2010
================================================================================

This assignment is due by:
	Day:    Tuesday, June 1st, 2010
	Time:   Before the end of lab (4:00pm) (NOT 11:55 PM)

================================================================================
            TURN IN THIS ASSIGNMENT ELECTRONICALLY USING T-Square.
             SUBMISSIONS WHICH ARE LATE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
================================================================================

================
Your Assignment:
================

Open Logisim and create a circuit called timedlab1.circ.
There will be three parts to this assignment:

1. Implement a Decoder with the appropriate number of inputs and 8 wires of output.

2. In the same file but in a different circuit implement a 8 to 16 bit sign extender.

3. In the same file but in a different circuit implement a multiplexor with 8 wires 
   of input the appropriate number of select lines and one output.


Be sure to label all significant parts of the circuit appropriately. (e.g., label each input)!

Banned Components!
------------------

You may only use basic gates with wires.  You may use stuff like 3 or more input AND gates
You may NOT use Combinational Analysis to do this timed lab!

Questions: If you are unsure of what questions mean, the TA's will clarify them
    to the best of their ability. We will not be able to answer any questions about
    how to reach a solution to the lab questions. For example, we can't answer the
    question "What is a decoder?" (that's what we're asking you), but we can answer
    questions like "How do I specify my output?"

* You may use any of the following resources:
     - Your mind
     - Blank paper for scratch work

* You may NOT use:
     - The Internet (except the T-Square Assignment page)
     - Any files that you or anyone else has previously written (no home drive,
            no previous T-Square submissions, NO existing files you can access)
     - Textbook
     - Notes
     - Email
     - IM
     - Contact with any other person besides TAs

* Submit only the files we tell you. Do not submit a link to your file on some server
We will not grade that as you can easily change the file and the timestamp of when the
file was uploaded.

* Failure to follow these rules will be violating the Georgia Tech Honor
  Code. When in doubt, simply ask the TAs.

*YOU MUST SUBMIT BY THE END OF YOUR LAB PERIOD. Bear in mind that the clock on your computer
may be a few minutes slow. T-Square has the multiple submissions option so don't be afraid
to resubmit if you fix something. You are supposed to have a full class period to work, and
we are letting you use the 15 minutes between classes to make sure you have submitted your work.
WE WILL NOT ACCEPT LATE SUBMISSIONS, be they 1 second or 1 hour late.

===========
Submission:
===========

Submit your circuit called timedlab1.circ to T-Square.

Grading:
========

Grading is based on functionality.  No credit is awarded
simply for showing up; you must test and verify your circuits.

Attendance:
-----------
You MUST be present in the states lab while you work on this and all future timed labs.

If you submit work but we do not have a record of your attendance then you will receive a 0 on your submission. NO EXCEPTIONS!
